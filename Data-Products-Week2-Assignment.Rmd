Below we show Starbucks locations in the Baltimore area. The data was acquired from Wikimapia.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
starbucks <- read.csv("starbucks.csv", header = FALSE)
names(starbucks) <- c("name", "lat","lng","east", "west", "south", "north")
coffeeIcon <- makeIcon("http://img.clipartall.com/coffee-cup-clip-art-at-clker-coffee-clipart-600_519.png", iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31)
starbucks %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(icon=coffeeIcon,popup=starbucks$name)
```
